# The Friday Night Funkin Song Credit Script

I saw there was a lack of help for making these awesome song credit things so I decided to make my own public and (customizable) script!

The script here is fully customizable and I made it easy for beginners to understand with comments inside the scripts.


### Current Features
* Fully Customizeable with a song data table
  - Including Song Name, Artist Name, Charter Name, Box Color, and Time Spent on Screen.
* A setting to turn off the names! (Causes it to work on all songs!)

### Future Updates
* Creating a brand new side script thats just the current song (like the toggle)
* Fixing up the main credits code to be more reliable and optimized (200 lines????)
